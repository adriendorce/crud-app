My learning was focused on server side JavaScript. I used Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to build a simple web application. I executed CRUD operations and worked in a database platform.

## Optimizations

Make the app look better by adding (more) CSS and functionality.  Add new tasks through an input, which users can then edit or delete. 


## Lessons Learned:

Learned how to create a fullstack web application from scratch to deployment. Understand what Express, Node.js, and MongoDB are used for. CRUD operations. Save, read, update, and delete from MongoDB.
